# Google Play Store App Analytics

## Overview

This project is focused on analyzing the Google Play Store dataset to gain insights into app ratings, categories, user reviews, and more. The analysis leverages Python and several popular libraries to explore, clean, and visualize the data.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and correcting data types.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gaining insights into app categories, ratings distribution, and review counts.
- **Visualizations**: Creating visual representations of the data for better understanding and communication.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For potential machine learning models (if applicable in the analysis).

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repo-name.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd repo-name
   ```
3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Open the `.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab to view and execute the code.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about various apps available on the Google Play Store, including ratings, reviews, categories, and more.

## Future Work

- Enhance the analysis by including machine learning models for predicting app ratings or categories.
- Expand the EDA section with more in-depth analysis.
